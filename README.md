# Multi-Label_Image_Classification
Multi Genre Classification using Movie Posters


This is an implementation of the following tutorial (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/04/build-first-multi-label-image-classification-model-python/) on Multi-Lable Image Classification. Three variations of a multi-label classification were trained using the three notebooks in the notebook directory, their details are as follows.

* Multi_Label_Classification : 
This implementation follows the tutorial closely

* Improving_Multi_Label_Classification_with_weighted_Loss_Function                                                               : This implementation tries to improve upon the previous implementation by using a weighted loss function

* Experimentation for improving Multi-Label Classification                                                                        : This implementation improves by focusing the classification on the most populated samples and employing a voting model for     classification 

The LoggedChanges.pdf lists the main additions to basic implementation to improve the model performance. In addition a rather rudimentary webapp has been deployed to https://immense-garden-91840.herokuapp.com/ that can classify movie posters.
